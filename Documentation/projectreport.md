## 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning


**âœ… Step 1a. Create an AWS or AWS Educate Account** :
**âœ… Step 1b. Mount EBS Snapshot**:

- Create a volume of the publicly available EBS Snapshot for Linux Machine in your region same as your EC2 Instance.
- Attach the volume to your instance and Mount it to your file system using the following commands:

```
$ lsblk                              //TO list all the blocks
$ sudo mkdir /data                   //Creating the directory for mounting
$ mount /dev/xvdf /data              //mounting /dev/xvdf on the /data folder created

```

**âœ… Step 1c. Extract the csv files to HDFS**:

- The data stored in the EBS snapshot is in the form of csv files which are in a zipped folder. We use the following script to extract it to HDFS folder.
