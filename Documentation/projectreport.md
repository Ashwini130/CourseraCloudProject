## 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning


**âœ… Step 1a. Create an AWS or AWS Educate Account** :
**âœ… Step 1b. Mount EBS Snapshot**:

- Create a volume of the publicly available EBS Snapshot for Linux Machine in your region same as your EC2 Instance.
- Attach the volume to your instance and Mount it to your file system using the following commands:

```
$ lsblk                              //TO list all the blocks
$ sudo mkdir /data                   //Creating the directory for mounting
$ mount /dev/xvdf /data              //mounting /dev/xvdf on the /data folder created

```

**âœ… Step 1c. Extract the csv files to HDFS**:

- The data stored in the EBS snapshot is in the form of csv files which are in a zipped folder. We use the following script to extract it to HDFS folder.

**âœ… Step 1d. Extract the csv files to HDFS**:

- Clean the extracted files using Spark. The cleaning operations performed on the dataset were as follows:

1. Post Data Exploration and examining a subset of the data it was observed that there are few rows of data having null values in ArrDelay columns(for flights that were cancelled). These null values might interfere with out analysis so we drop these columns

2. In the Description of Transportation DataSet, it is mentioned that for some years the data collected has more columns, (which are not significant to out analysis) so we restrict our data columns to about 56 columns only(as opposed to some csv files having 75 columns)
