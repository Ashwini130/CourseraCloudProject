## 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning


**âœ… Step 1a. Create an AWS or AWS Educate Account** :
**âœ… Step 1b. Mount EBS Snapshot**:

- Create a volume of the publicly available EBS Snapshot for Linux Machine in your region same as your EC2 Instance.
- Attach the volume to your instance and Mount it to your file system using the following commands:

```
$ lsblk                              //TO list all the blocks
$ sudo mkdir /data                   //Creating the directory for mounting
$ mount /dev/xvdf /data              //mounting /dev/xvdf on the /data folder created

```

**âœ… Step 1c. Extract the csv files to HDFS**:

- The data stored in the EBS snapshot is in the form of csv files which are in a zipped folder. We use the following script to extract it to HDFS folder.

* [Extraction script on GitHub](https://github.com/Ashwini130/CourseraCloudProject/tree/master/Scripts/moveDataToHadoop.sh)

```
$moveDataToHadoop /data /DATA
```
**âœ… Step 1d. Extract the csv files to HDFS**:

- Clean the extracted files using Spark. The cleaning operations performed on the dataset were as follows:

1. Post Data Exploration and examining a subset of the data it was observed that there are few rows of data having null values in ArrDelay columns(for flights that were cancelled). These null values might interfere with out analysis so we drop these columns

```
df = df.na.drop(Array("ArrDelay"));
```
2. In the Description of Transportation DataSet, it is mentioned that for some years the data collected has more columns, (which are not significant to out analysis) so we restrict our data columns to about 56 columns only(as opposed to some csv files having 75 columns)

```
val sliceCols = df.columns.slice(0, 55)
df = df.select(sliceCols.map(name=>col(name)):_*)
```

* [ETL script on GitHub](https://github.com/Ashwini130/CourseraCloudProject/tree/master/Scripts/ETL_script.sh)

```
$spark-shell -i ETL_script.scala
```

(make sure you have your hadoop cluster already setup with spark installed over hadoop before running scala script. For quickly setting up a 4 node hadoop cluster, follow this link : )

## 2. Data Analysis using Hadoop and PySpark

Following diagram specifies the architecture used to integrate various big data tools used for analysis. We will explore them step by step when we answer the given questions.

![Architecture Image](images/architecture.PNG?raw=true)

* Group 1

 **1. Rank the top 10 most popular airports by numbers of flights to/from the airport.**<br>
 **2.Rank the top 10 airlines by on-time arrival performance.**
 
 * Group 2
 
**1. For each airport X, rank the top-10 carriers in decreasing order of on-time departure performance from X.**
**2. For each airport X, rank the top-10 airports in decreasing order of on-time departure performance from X.**
**3. For each source-destination pair X-Y, rank the top-10 carriers in decreasing order of on-time arrival performance at Y from X.**

* Group 3

**1) Does the popularity distribution of airports follow a Zipf distribution? If not, what distribution does it follow?**

**2) Tom wants to travel from airport X to airport Z. However, Tom also wants to stop at airport Y for some sightseeing on the way. More concretely, Tom has the following requirements
a) The second leg of the journey (flight Y-Z) must depart two days after the first leg (flight X-Y). For example, if X-Y departs on January 5, 2008, Y-Z must depart on January 7, 2008.
b) Tom wants his flights scheduled to depart airport X before 12:00 PM local time and to depart airport Y after 12:00 PM local time.
c) Tom wants to arrive at each destination with as little delay as possible. You can assume you know the actual delay of each flight.

Your mission (should you choose to accept it!) is to find, for each X-Y-Z and day/month (dd/mm) combination in the year 2008, the two flights (X-Y and Y-Z) that satisfy constraints (a) and (b) and have the best individual performance with respect to constraint (c), if such flights exist.**
